Re. Start

Restart insanity
Sailing on a frozen sea of time
Never stops
These clocks are broken
Theyre smashed into
A place devoid of tragedy
Symptoms show in you and me
Losing time we redefine what's real
Then start again

I've seen the future there's no past
And what we wish for will not last
Forever's far too long to feel
As if our future will not last
And what we wish for is in the past
Our actions redefine what's real
Then start again

I've seen the future there's no past
I've seen the future
